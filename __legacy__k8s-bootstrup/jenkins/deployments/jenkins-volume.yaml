# Itâ€™s worth noting that, in the above spec, hostPath uses the /data/jenkins-volume/ of your node to emulate network-attached storage.
# This approach is only suited for development and testing purposes. For production, you should provide a network resource like a
# Google Compute Engine persistent disk, or an Amazon Elastic Block Store volume.
